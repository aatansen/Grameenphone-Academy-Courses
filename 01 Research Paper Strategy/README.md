<summary>Class 02 : Types of Research Paper and Research Paper Length</summary>

**Types of Research Paper**

- Analytical Research Paper (review paper)
    - A review paper refers to the study and survey of a recently published research paper on a specific topic or subject.
    
    > In analytical writing, an author gathers information from a number of credible and reliable sources and then combines the information to come up with an analysis in the form of an essay.
    >
- Argumentative (Persuasive) Research Paper Definition Paper (problem statement - idea)
    - When a researchers partake in an original study or investigation of a unique topic, the findings of that study are presented as a research paper.
    
    > The argumentative writing goes beyond demonstrating your ideas in a manner that support your thesis statement. An author takes one side of an argument and develops it.
    > 
- Compare and Contrast Paper
- Cause and Effect Paper
- Interpretative Paper
- Experimental Research Paper

**Length of Research Paper**

- Conference Paper `4-6` Pages.
- Journal Paper `12 or more than 20` Pages.

**Conference Paper Example**

- [Hybrid CNN-SVM Model for Brain Tumor Classification utilizing Different Datasets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9641201)

        In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation and classification
        model using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network that includes a multiscale approach. 
        One of the differences of our proposal with respect to previous works is that input 
        images are processed in three spatial scales along different processing pathways. This
        mechanism is inspired in the inherent operation of the Human Visual System. The proposed
        neural model can analyze MRI images containing three types of tumors: meningioma, glioma,
        and pituitary tumor, over sagittal, coronal, and axial views and does not need preprocessing
        of input images to remove skull or vertebral column parts in advance. The performance
        of our method on a publicly available MRI image dataset of 3064 slices from 233 patients
        is compared with previously classical machine learning and deep learning published methods. 
        In the comparison, our method remarkably obtained a tumor classification accuracy of 0.973,
        higher than the other approaches using the same database.

        Background: In its early development, radar (radio detection and ranging) was primarily 
        used by the navy, the military, and the aviation services, as well as space organizations
        for security and monitoring purposes. Nowadays, the demand of radar is expanding. 
        Research has been conducted to overcome the limitations of radar.
        
        Objective: One of the current limitations to detect moving object. The current paper aims
        to fill the gap in the literature by using a radar system in the identification of moving
        object, capturing the distance, direction, radar pulse duration and object shape simultaneously.
        Velocity or the object’s speed towards or away from the radar was determined by using an
        algorithm to obtain the precision.
        
        Methods: The accuracy of distance measurement and angle is ensured by comparing the real
        values and the values obtained by the radar. The objects under study consist of metal 
        and non-metal. Novelty of this work is the accurate detection of moving objects with 
        suitable algorithms using only one Arduino UNO and one ultrasonic sensor.
        
        Results: The experiment design yielded much better efficiency than previous works. 
        The proposed method predicted the exact speed of the object detected by the radar system.
        The experiment has successfully proven the accuracy of moving object sensor.
        
        Conclusion: Besides proper distance and velocity, a large set of data was taken to 
        find the accuracy of the radar for objects of different shapes. For a cylindrical object,
        the radar provided 100% efficiency in a constant environment when the object was 5 cm away.
        The accuracy decreased to 30% when the distance was 17 cm away. The limitation of this 
        system is that it was unable to detect small object or if the object was very close (1 cm).

<summary>Class 01 : Research Ethics</summary>

**What does it means**

- Ethics —> Ethics are the set of rules that govern our expectations of our own and others’ behavior

**Research Ethics**

- Research ethics are the set of ethical guidelines that guides us on how scientific research should be conducted and disseminated.
    - follow the guideline of scientific research
- Research ethics govern the standards of conduct for scientific researchers. It is the guideline for responsibly conducting the research.
    - follow the world wide research guideline
- Research that implicates human subjects or contributors rears distinctive and multifaceted ethical, legitimate, communal and administrative concerns.
    - maintain the privacy of collected data, info
    - verify the collected data is real
    - maintain all the issues
- Research ethics is unambiguously concerned in the examination of ethical issues that are upraised when individuals are involved as participants n the study.
    - involvement of human privacy is first
- Research ethics committee/ `Institutional Review Board` (IRB) reviews whether the research is ethical enough or not to protect the rights, dignity and welfare of the respondents.
    - collected data is correct, quality of data is good then it is ethical

**Research Objective**

- The first and comprehensive objective —> to guard/protect human participants, their dignity, rights and welfare .
- The second objective —> to make sure that research is directed in a manner that assists welfares of persons, groups and/or civilization as a whole.
- The third objective —> to inspect particular research events and schemes for their ethical reliability, considering issues such as the controlling risk, protection of privacy and the progression of informed consent.

**Ethical Principles of Research**

- Honesty (**সততা**)
- Responsibility (**দায়িত্ব**)
- Privacy (**গোপনীয়তা**)
- Confidentiality (**বিশ্বাসপ্রবণতা**)
- Autonomy (**ব্যক্তিস্বাধীনতা**)

- Competence (**কর্মদক্ষতা**)
- Integrity (**সততা**)
- Justice (**ন্যায়পরতা**)
- Dignity (**মর্যাদা**)

**Research Ethics For Authors**

- Research ethics are moral principles that guide researchers to conduct and report research without deception or intention to harm the participants of the study or members of the society as a whole, whether knowingly or unknowingly.

**Some Ethics For Authors**

- Authors wishing to publish their papers in journals/conference must abide to the following:
    - Accurately present their research findings
    - Including an objective discussion of the significance of findings.
    - All and only those who qualify for authorship should be included as authors, and their contribution given in the manuscript.
    - Any facts that might be perceived as a possible conflict of interest of the author(s) must be disclosed in the paper prior to submission.
    - Data and methods used in the research need to be presented in sufficient detail in the paper so that other researchers can replicate the work. Raw data must be made publicly available unless there is a compelling reason otherwise (e.g., patient confidentiality).
    - Simultaneous submission of manuscripts to more than one journal is not permitted.
    - Original research results must be novel and not, including being previously published in another language.
    - For any content previously published (including quotations, figures or tables), any necessary permission to publish must be obtained from the copyright holder.
    - Errors and inaccuracies found after publication must be promptly communicated to the Editorial Office.
    - Authors must not use the words, figures, or ideas of others without attribution. All sources must be cited at the point they are used, and reuse of wording must be limited and be attributed or quoted in the text.
    - Authors must declare all potential interests in a `Conflicts of interest` section, which should explain why the interest may be a conflict.
    - Research misconduct means making up or falsifying data, manipulating data analyses, or

<summary>Class 02 : Journal and conference selection</summary>

**For Conference Paper**

- First, find a conference that is looking for submissions.
- Search on Google
- Utilizing contacts and connections you might have within any professional organizations
- Social media sources (Group , Pages)
- Publisher quality, indexing
- Does it match my field
- Track down running , upcoming conferences

**For Journal Paper**

- Find journal based on scope and ranking

**Top Tips For Selection**

- Make sure your paper fits within the scope of the journal/ of conference
- Assess the credentials of the journal or publisher
- Browse the content they publish for quality and relevance to your field
- Check the quality of their website
- Check what tools and services they offer to authors
- Submit your research to one journal only, but check if they offer transfers to other journals
- Follow the instructions for authors carefully

**Two main factors to consider when choosing a journal**

- your paper fits within the journal’s scope, and the reputation of the journal itself.
    1. The reputation of the journal. A journal's impact factor is only one measure of its reputation, but not always the most important. You need to consider the prestige of the authors that publish in the journal, and the size of the journal's readership.
    2. You have to chose the journal you think is the best fit for your study and your goals and standard for your manuscript.
- You must observe the registration fee

**More things to aware of**

- Quality Criteria = Impact factor
- Be aware  of FAKE journals !!!
- Only One impact factor is given by “Thomson Reuters”
- Master Journal List of Thomson Reuters - get impact factors. Which is real and shows the quality criteria

**Types and Quality**

- Journal with 30-40 H-index is good enough.
- H-index actually means how much citation that journal received.
- Journals are divided into 4 quarters: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.
- Q1 represent first 25% of journals.
- Q2 represent second 25% of journals.
- Q3 represent third 25% of journals.
- Q4 represent rest 25% of journals.
- Q1 Journals indicate the top 25% journal.
- Q1 and Q2 are really good journals.
- When a journal is listed in “Master Journal List”, it means that has high level of editorial record
