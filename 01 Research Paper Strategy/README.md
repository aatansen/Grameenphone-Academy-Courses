**What is Research**

- Research is defined as the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing
knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies and understandings.
- This could include synthesis and analysis of previous research
to the extent that it leads to new and creative outcomes.

**Aim of Research**

- New Knowledge / Information
- Finding Application
- Verifying existing knowledge
- To improve the life style

**What is important feature ?**

- Quality Research
    
    > It is important to maintain quality than quantity. It should be good, verified research.
    > 

**Research Paper**

- A paper that outlines a research challenge, explains why it is important to solve, describes a new solution/answer, and provides some verifications.

**Research paper Example (`Journal Paper`)**

- [Moving Object Detection Using Ultrasonic Radar with Proper Distance, Direction, and Object Shape Analysis](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Moving-Object-Detection-Using-Ultrasonic-Radar-with-Biswas-Abedin/85be687d28b02c914fa6b36dbb03966604a14487)

<summary>Class 02 : Types of Research Paper and Research Paper Length</summary>

**Types of Research Paper**

- Analytical Research Paper (review paper)
    - A review paper refers to the study and survey of a recently published research paper on a specific topic or subject.
    
    > In analytical writing, an author gathers information from a number of credible and reliable sources and then combines the information to come up with an analysis in the form of an essay.
    >
- Argumentative (Persuasive) Research Paper Definition Paper (problem statement - idea)
    - When a researchers partake in an original study or investigation of a unique topic, the findings of that study are presented as a research paper.
    
    > The argumentative writing goes beyond demonstrating your ideas in a manner that support your thesis statement. An author takes one side of an argument and develops it.
    > 
- Compare and Contrast Paper
- Cause and Effect Paper
- Interpretative Paper
- Experimental Research Paper

**Length of Research Paper**

- Conference Paper `4-6` Pages.
- Journal Paper `12 or more than 20` Pages.

**Conference Paper Example**

- [Hybrid CNN-SVM Model for Brain Tumor Classification utilizing Different Datasets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9641201)
- Title
- Author name
- Authors affiliation
- Abstract
- Keywords
- Introduction
- Methodology
- Dataset details
- Steps , flowchart , block diagram
- Research analysis
- Environment
- Mathematical expression
- Comparison

- Acknowledgement
- References (`14-18`)

**Which Paper is Best**

- It is difficult to say which is best
- Both Research & Review paper are good.
- Focus on where the paper will be submitted.
- Must justify the value of a journal / conference before publishing there.

**Should I Submit My Paper to a Conference or a Journal**

- It depend on research topic
- If it required more analysis —> `Journal Paper`
- Less length analysis —> `Conference Paper`
- Must verify the quality before submission.

        In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation and classification
        model using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network that includes a multiscale approach. 
        One of the differences of our proposal with respect to previous works is that input 
        images are processed in three spatial scales along different processing pathways. This
        mechanism is inspired in the inherent operation of the Human Visual System. The proposed
        neural model can analyze MRI images containing three types of tumors: meningioma, glioma,
        and pituitary tumor, over sagittal, coronal, and axial views and does not need preprocessing
        of input images to remove skull or vertebral column parts in advance. The performance
        of our method on a publicly available MRI image dataset of 3064 slices from 233 patients
        is compared with previously classical machine learning and deep learning published methods. 
        In the comparison, our method remarkably obtained a tumor classification accuracy of 0.973,
        higher than the other approaches using the same database.

        Background: In its early development, radar (radio detection and ranging) was primarily 
        used by the navy, the military, and the aviation services, as well as space organizations
        for security and monitoring purposes. Nowadays, the demand of radar is expanding. 
        Research has been conducted to overcome the limitations of radar.
        
        Objective: One of the current limitations to detect moving object. The current paper aims
        to fill the gap in the literature by using a radar system in the identification of moving
        object, capturing the distance, direction, radar pulse duration and object shape simultaneously.
        Velocity or the object’s speed towards or away from the radar was determined by using an
        algorithm to obtain the precision.
        
        Methods: The accuracy of distance measurement and angle is ensured by comparing the real
        values and the values obtained by the radar. The objects under study consist of metal 
        and non-metal. Novelty of this work is the accurate detection of moving objects with 
        suitable algorithms using only one Arduino UNO and one ultrasonic sensor.
        
        Results: The experiment design yielded much better efficiency than previous works. 
        The proposed method predicted the exact speed of the object detected by the radar system.
        The experiment has successfully proven the accuracy of moving object sensor.
        
        Conclusion: Besides proper distance and velocity, a large set of data was taken to 
        find the accuracy of the radar for objects of different shapes. For a cylindrical object,
        the radar provided 100% efficiency in a constant environment when the object was 5 cm away.
        The accuracy decreased to 30% when the distance was 17 cm away. The limitation of this 
        system is that it was unable to detect small object or if the object was very close (1 cm).

<summary>Class 02 : Discussion</summary>

**How to write Discussion**

- It is optional
- we can add it in result part
- Author describes, analyzes, and interprets their findings.
- explain the significance of those result
- tie everything back to the research question
- how do the result bridge the gap

**What is the purpose of a Discussion Section**

- The discussion reviews the findings and puts them into the context of the overall research.
- It brings together all the sections that came before it and allows a reader to see the connections between each part of the research paper.
- In a discussion section, the author engages in three necessary steps: interpretation, analysis, and explanation.
- An effective discussion section will tell a reader why the research results are important and where they fit in the current literature.

**How to organize “Discussion” Section**

    C -->D[Conclude with a restatement of the most</br> significant findings and their implications]
```

**Things to avoid**

- Don’t rewrite the result section
- Don’t draw conclusions from the findings without support
- Don’t bring up new information
- Don’t analyze only literature section

**Example**

- [Moving Object Detection Using Ultrasonic Radar with Proper Distance, Direction, and Object Shape Analysis](https://e-journal.unair.ac.id/JISEBI/article/view/18840)

<summary>Class 03 : Conclusion</summary>

**How to write Conclusion**

- The conclusion of a research paper restates the research problem, summarizes your arguments or findings, and discusses the implications
- You can also include the future work of your research
- Indicate opportunities for future research
- **What is the main purpose of a Conclusion Section**
    - Restating the research problem which is addressed in the paper
        - which problem I am solving
    - Summarizing the overall arguments or findings
- **Abstract and Conclusion are same?**
    - Abstract —> Its a short note that express the contents of the work
    - Conclusion —> Its a statement / decision reached by the researcher based on findings in the research

- To provide in general report

**Not to forget**

- Mentioning limitations but which actually didn’t hamper the core idea of research study
- Maintain the word limit
- Mention future work
