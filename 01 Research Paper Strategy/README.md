**What is Research**

- Research is defined as the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing
knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies and understandings.
- This could include synthesis and analysis of previous research
to the extent that it leads to new and creative outcomes.

**Aim of Research**

- New Knowledge / Information
- Finding Application
- Verifying existing knowledge
- To improve the life style

**What is important feature ?**

- Quality Research
    
    > It is important to maintain quality than quantity. It should be good, verified research.
    > 

**Research Paper**

- A paper that outlines a research challenge, explains why it is important to solve, describes a new solution/answer, and provides some verifications.

**Research paper Example (`Journal Paper`)**

- [Moving Object Detection Using Ultrasonic Radar with Proper Distance, Direction, and Object Shape Analysis](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Moving-Object-Detection-Using-Ultrasonic-Radar-with-Biswas-Abedin/85be687d28b02c914fa6b36dbb03966604a14487)

<summary>Class 02 : Types of Research Paper and Research Paper Length</summary>

**Types of Research Paper**

- Analytical Research Paper (review paper)
    - A review paper refers to the study and survey of a recently published research paper on a specific topic or subject.
    
    > In analytical writing, an author gathers information from a number of credible and reliable sources and then combines the information to come up with an analysis in the form of an essay.
    >
- Argumentative (Persuasive) Research Paper Definition Paper (problem statement - idea)
    - When a researchers partake in an original study or investigation of a unique topic, the findings of that study are presented as a research paper.
    
    > The argumentative writing goes beyond demonstrating your ideas in a manner that support your thesis statement. An author takes one side of an argument and develops it.
    > 
- Compare and Contrast Paper
- Cause and Effect Paper
- Interpretative Paper
- Experimental Research Paper

**Length of Research Paper**

- Conference Paper `4-6` Pages.
- Journal Paper `12 or more than 20` Pages.

**Conference Paper Example**

- [Hybrid CNN-SVM Model for Brain Tumor Classification utilizing Different Datasets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9641201)
- Title
- Author name
- Authors affiliation
- Abstract
- Keywords
- Introduction
- Methodology
- Dataset details
- Steps , flowchart , block diagram
- Research analysis
- Environment
- Mathematical expression

- Acknowledgement
- References (`14-18`)

**Which Paper is Best**

- It is difficult to say which is best
- Both Research & Review paper are good.
- Focus on where the paper will be submitted.
- Must justify the value of a journal / conference before publishing there.

**Should I Submit My Paper to a Conference or a Journal**

- It depend on research topic
- If it required more analysis —> `Journal Paper`
- Less length analysis —> `Conference Paper`
- Must verify the quality before submission.

        In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation and classification
        model using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network that includes a multiscale approach. 
        One of the differences of our proposal with respect to previous works is that input 
        images are processed in three spatial scales along different processing pathways. This
        mechanism is inspired in the inherent operation of the Human Visual System. The proposed
        neural model can analyze MRI images containing three types of tumors: meningioma, glioma,
        and pituitary tumor, over sagittal, coronal, and axial views and does not need preprocessing
        of input images to remove skull or vertebral column parts in advance. The performance
        of our method on a publicly available MRI image dataset of 3064 slices from 233 patients
        is compared with previously classical machine learning and deep learning published methods. 
        In the comparison, our method remarkably obtained a tumor classification accuracy of 0.973,
        higher than the other approaches using the same database.

        Background: In its early development, radar (radio detection and ranging) was primarily 
        used by the navy, the military, and the aviation services, as well as space organizations
        for security and monitoring purposes. Nowadays, the demand of radar is expanding. 
        Research has been conducted to overcome the limitations of radar.
        
        Objective: One of the current limitations to detect moving object. The current paper aims
        to fill the gap in the literature by using a radar system in the identification of moving
        object, capturing the distance, direction, radar pulse duration and object shape simultaneously.
        Velocity or the object’s speed towards or away from the radar was determined by using an
        algorithm to obtain the precision.
        
        Methods: The accuracy of distance measurement and angle is ensured by comparing the real
        values and the values obtained by the radar. The objects under study consist of metal 
        and non-metal. Novelty of this work is the accurate detection of moving objects with 
        suitable algorithms using only one Arduino UNO and one ultrasonic sensor.
        
        Results: The experiment design yielded much better efficiency than previous works. 
        The proposed method predicted the exact speed of the object detected by the radar system.
        The experiment has successfully proven the accuracy of moving object sensor.
        
        Conclusion: Besides proper distance and velocity, a large set of data was taken to 
        find the accuracy of the radar for objects of different shapes. For a cylindrical object,
        the radar provided 100% efficiency in a constant environment when the object was 5 cm away.
        The accuracy decreased to 30% when the distance was 17 cm away. The limitation of this 
        system is that it was unable to detect small object or if the object was very close (1 cm).
