**What is Research**

- Research is defined as the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing
knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies and understandings.
- This could include synthesis and analysis of previous research
to the extent that it leads to new and creative outcomes.

**Aim of Research**

- New Knowledge / Information
- Finding Application
- Verifying existing knowledge
- To improve the life style

**What is important feature ?**

- Quality Research
    
    > It is important to maintain quality than quantity. It should be good, verified research.
    > 

**Research Paper**

- A paper that outlines a research challenge, explains why it is important to solve, describes a new solution/answer, and provides some verifications.

**Research paper Example (`Journal Paper`)**

- [Moving Object Detection Using Ultrasonic Radar with Proper Distance, Direction, and Object Shape Analysis](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Moving-Object-Detection-Using-Ultrasonic-Radar-with-Biswas-Abedin/85be687d28b02c914fa6b36dbb03966604a14487)
- Title
- Author names

- literature review
- Methodology
- Flowchart + Block diagram + Picture
- Result + Result analysis + Visual representation + Graphs
- Discussion
- Comparison with previous work
- Conclusions
- References

**Necessary Tips For Enhancing Skill**

- Finding relevant sources
- Language proficiency
- Organizing information
- Time management

<summary>Class 02 : Types of Research Paper and Research Paper Length</summary>

**Types of Research Paper**

- Analytical Research Paper (review paper)
    - A review paper refers to the study and survey of a recently published research paper on a specific topic or subject.
    
    > In analytical writing, an author gathers information from a number of credible and reliable sources and then combines the information to come up with an analysis in the form of an essay.
    >
- Argumentative (Persuasive) Research Paper Definition Paper (problem statement - idea)
    - When a researchers partake in an original study or investigation of a unique topic, the findings of that study are presented as a research paper.
    
    > The argumentative writing goes beyond demonstrating your ideas in a manner that support your thesis statement. An author takes one side of an argument and develops it.
    > 
- Compare and Contrast Paper
- Cause and Effect Paper
- Interpretative Paper
- Experimental Research Paper

**Length of Research Paper**

- Conference Paper `4-6` Pages.
- Journal Paper `12 or more than 20` Pages.

**Conference Paper Example**

- [Hybrid CNN-SVM Model for Brain Tumor Classification utilizing Different Datasets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9641201)
- Title
- Author name
- Authors affiliation
- Abstract
- Keywords
- Introduction
- Methodology
- Dataset details
- Steps , flowchart , block diagram
- Research analysis
- Environment
- Mathematical expression
- Comparison
- Conclusions
- Acknowledgement
- References (`14-18`)

**Which Paper is Best**

- It is difficult to say which is best
- Both Research & Review paper are good.
- Focus on where the paper will be submitted.
- Must justify the value of a journal / conference before publishing there.

**Should I Submit My Paper to a Conference or a Journal**

- It depend on research topic
- If it required more analysis —> `Journal Paper`
- Less length analysis —> `Conference Paper`
- Must verify the quality before submission.
